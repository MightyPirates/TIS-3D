# Custom Module

![4](item:tis3d:moduleCustom)

The Custom Module is interesting in that it's behavior is markedly different between universes.

In most universes, the Custom Module has no functionality at all.
In this case, it may even be unobtainable.

In some universes, the Custom Module has only one function, in which case placing it will perform that function.

In an even further limited set of universes, the Custom Module has more than one function.
These are switched between by shift-right-clicking.

The activities, abilities, and other information about the Custom Module is limited.
If you can even get it at all, it usually has a purpose.
Some people say there are those who administrate universes - perhaps they might understand the Custom Module?
